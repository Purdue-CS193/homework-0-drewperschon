After your depression is cured and you have a nice fire to sit by, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/lebron/) you can discuss King James.

Now that you are happily discussing King James next to a warm fire, you can now easily sleep at night with [a variety of comforters](https://www.amazon.com/lebron-james-bedding/s?k=lebron+james+bedding).
